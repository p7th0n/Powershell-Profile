# Powershell profile

This is my Powershell profile.

## Getting Started

* Installation process: clone or copy to $env:USERPROFILE\Documents\WindowsPowerShell.  Or just cherry pick pieces.
* Software dependencies: Windows 10, 8 or 7
* Read about Posh-Git if you are a Git user.
* The Profile is a good place for command line aliases for commands not included in Powershell. Examples are like Windows cmd commands, shortened commands to save on typing.
* For longer aliases or commands Powershell functions work.  Look at **Remove-Service** in the Profile for an example of a _missing_ Powershell command.
* Keep in mind -- if the Profile gets bloated Powershell is slow to start up.
